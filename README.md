# gamer.church
Repo for the site files of GAMER CHURCH!

Note: A lot of the scripts and templates for both gamer.church and console.gamer.church are assembled and configured manually after the themes and plugins are activated. Many of the stylesheets and templates depend on static media files uploaded directly to the website and will not work if activated on a new WordPress site; you'll need to swap those out with new media or manually retrieve the corresponding media from the gamer.church website.
